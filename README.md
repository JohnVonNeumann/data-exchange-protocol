# On providing feedback and participating in the development of the technical specifications

We welcome your feedback and participation in the development of the technical specifications. 

For this, we use an ADR-inspired process.

To make a meaningful contribution:

1. Create an ADR proposal in the [decisions/log](decisions/log) with status `In Progress`
    1. If possible, already create the changes to the technical specification text as well (see above)
2. Create a Pull Request with the ADR proposal and optionally the specification changes
3. Once there is consensus on the ADR proposal, the ADR proposal is merged into the `main` branch


## History of decisions

Accepted decisions are stored in the directory [decisions/log](decisions/log) under branch `main`.
